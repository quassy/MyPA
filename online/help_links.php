There is a rough quickly done port of the -={BP}=- Toolbox available for 
everyone here now: <br>
<br>
http://caladan.duke.de:31339/pa<br> 
<br>
It is a quick and rough port - some graphical stat options dont work yet, the 
BC doesnt have PDS fields, the stats where done hastily in a night etc. etc. 
but at least the design _rocks_ :P <br>
<br>
I may write some explanations of how to use etc. later ... (dont get your hopes 
up - people wait for that since PA rd4 ;). For now - if you see a weird icon - 
click on it - it may be one of the helppages ;) <br>
<br>
The data is updated from 15 minute snapshots every 15 minutes. <br>
<br>
Have fun, <br>
Bit.<br>
