This project is a (yet another) fork of the MyPHPpa code from Khan. The aim is to have an updated version for PHP 5 / 7 and many SQL-based databases by using PDO. Internationalization, performance and basic security improvements (as the current state is not suitable for public web servers) are also planned. Changes and new features added to the game itself may be included in later releases, but they are _currently not a priority_.

## Installation

Check the seperate [install readme file](https://github.com/quassy/MyPA/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

## Original MyPHPpa

* The original project was once hosted at ~~[x-wars.net](http://khans.myphppa.x-wars.net/index.php)~~
* One of the latest releases is available at [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nezbit/)

MyPHPpa itself was inspired by the original [Planetarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetarion), a classic multiplayer browser game launched in 2000.
